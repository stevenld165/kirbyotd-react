# KirbyOTD React & API

This React webapp and API generates a new Kirby copy ability each day. It will only repeat once it goes through all copy abilities.
This project was made to learn both SQL and the process of creating a Backend REST API. It could probably be done a lot easier using a client-side, serverless localstorage solution instead of an entire API and Database, but it is about the journey and not the destination.

## Tech Stack
- Frontend: React
- Backend: Express.JS & Node.js
- Database: PostgreSQL
